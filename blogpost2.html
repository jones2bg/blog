        This week I decided to explore the unknown and mysterious topic of CSS Flex Containers.<br>
        During my internship, almost every single element contained in my frontend had some sort <br>
        of CSS applied. Out of all of those elements, <b>90%</b> of them use <code>display: flex;</code><br>

        <code class="display: block;"></code>
