    <p>
        This week I decided to explore the unknown and mysterious topic of CSS Flex Containers.<br>
        During my internship, almost every single element contained in my frontend had some sort <br>
        of CSS applied. Out of all of those elements, <b>90%</b> of them were modified with a <code>display: flex;</code> property.<br>
        I never understood why this <i>mystical</i> display property made everything fall into place perfectly.<br>
        On this note, I decided to deep-dive into the caverns of CSS documentation videos. <br>
        <code class="display: block;">
            display: flex;
        </code>
