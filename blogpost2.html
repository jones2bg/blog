        This week I decided to explore the unknown and mysterious topic of CSS Flex Containers.<br>
        During my internship, almost every single element contained in my frontend had some sort <br>
        of CSS applied. Out of all of those elements, <b>90%</b> of them were modified with a <code>display: flex;</code> property.<br>
        I never understood why this <i>mystical</i> display property made everything fall into place perfectly.<br>
        On this note, I decided to deep-dive into the caverns of CSS documentation. <br>
        <br>
        
        <code class="display: block;">
            display: flex;
        </code>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc">CSS Flex Video</a> <br>
        In this video above there is a lot of examples and documentation on how display properties work. <br>

        <i>"Every element on a web page is a rectangular box. The display property in CSS determines just how that rectangular box behaves." - Sara Cope, 2011</i><br>

        After looking at the two above resources, I truly feel like I understood how elements between CSS and HTML.<br>
