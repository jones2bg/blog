    <p>
        In my personal opinion, I would focus on building one iterative project for this class.<br>
        Where students would select a main project idea that would incorporate all the major elements of the course design.<br>
        This would make it so that the class would be iterative and the project would be similar to project lifecycles in industry.<br>
        The mini-labs and the labs were useful and extremely effective for learning, they are just very demanding.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What would be helpful to my students is the book. The book is amazing resource that was extremely useful to me.<br>
        Other resources I used are YouTube and Stack Overflow, which will also be very useful.<br>
        What could have been useful is the access to a TA that has experience in Web Development.<br>
        Overall, the course is designed very well and can be improved by having TAs to help with extra questions.<br>
