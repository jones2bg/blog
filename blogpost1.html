        This week I learned about a fullstack development package-based utility called <b>Node.js</b>.<br>
        Node.js is very useful and powerful, providing a package manager, <code>npm</code>, to quickly install and use packages.<br>
        Much like how <code>pip</code> works, you would just install any given Node.js package and off you go!<br>
        Node.js is built off of <code>JavaScript</code> which is both a front end and backend tool.<br>
        <br>
        The following instructions are how you install Node.js on Ubuntu systems:<br>
        <code>
            sudo apt update<br>
            sudo apt install nodejs<br>
            sudo apt install npm<br>
        </code>
        <br>
        Personally, I have only scraped the surface of the power of Node.js.<br>
        I have only ever used <code>Node.js</code> with <code>Vue.js</code> and <code>Vuetify with Vuex</code>, a Node.js package.<br>
        To understand the depth of Node.js, I looked into <code>React.js</code>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">here</a> , and <code>Angular.js</code>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">here</a>.<br>
        To my surprise, they are very similar to <code>Vue.js</code>, and I am wondering now, why was I <i>so</i> hesitant to start coding in either of these languages.<br>
        Overall, my studies yielded an important lesson: <b>Don't judge a book by it's cover.</b><br>
