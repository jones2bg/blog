    <p>
        This week I decided to explore a cool JavaScript library called <code>React.js</code>.<br>
        React is a <i>really, really</i> versatile library and can provide solutions for a broad range of problems.<br>
        What makes this library advantageous over <code>angularjs</code> and <code>Vue.js</code>, you might ask?<br>
        Well, it's pretty clear... the previous mentioned libraries and frameworks are built to specifications for applications specific to that developer.<br>
        <i>"But, what does that mean?"</i> - Essentially, each library and framework are built to be different from the other. <br>
        There is <b><i>no</i></b> true use for each of the aforementioned libraries and frameworks. Just use what is your favorite!<br>
        <br>
        Anyways... I got off topic accidentally.<br>
        <br>
        So, React has tons of cool things you can explore and try out.<br>
        The coolest thing that React has, is the RenderDOM. Which is essentially an element/constant renderer<br>
        This renderer allows you to display JavaScript content on the page with some some extra <i>spice</i>.<br>
        In conclusion, React is awesome and allows you to do a lot of fun things with it. <br>
